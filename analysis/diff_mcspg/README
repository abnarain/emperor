Controlled experiments with Isolation Transformer:
Blasted with a stream of {1,0} real signal
Filename:
m - Spectrogram with just magnitude of complex signals.
c - complex spectrogram 


I have set the center frequency to be 200 KHz,
Sample rate = 50 kHz, meaning our transmission bandwidth is 50kHz
