Controlled experiments with Isolation Transformer:
There is CFL bulb on the channel - noise_xx_y_<m,c>spg.pdf
There is CFL + covert communication on the channel - msg61_xx_y_<m,c>spg.pdf

Filename:
m - Spectrogram with just magnitude of complex signals.
c - complex spectrogram 


I have set the center frequency to be 200 KHz,
Sample rate = 50 kHz, meaning our transmission bandwidth is 50kHz
