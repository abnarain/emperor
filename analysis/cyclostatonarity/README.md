There are three plots in each image
1) Spectrogram
2) Time series of the magnitude of signal received
3) Bits after threshold of output of match filter.

This is done in a isolated powerline circuit with just the Desktop turned on.

One can see the cyclostationarity in the plots which decreases as we move
from 170KHz to 250KHz, i.e moving away from the frequency of operation of the desktop.

Powerline has a pink power spectral density because of the noise generated
by different devices.
